# Arch Mage

(Architecture Magician)

## Motivation

* Software is moving toward fully decentralized applications, and blockchain technologies are at the forefront of that decentralization
* However, blockchain technologies are young and only able to practically replace a small subset of current application logic
* Most investment in blockchain technology focus on the ideal side of the decentralized spectrum 
* There is still a large gap between current practical applications and the decentralized ideal
* Arch Mage is a collection of libraries that approach the divide from the opposite direction, meeting present day applications where they are at and enabling them to be more decentralized
